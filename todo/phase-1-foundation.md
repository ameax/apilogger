# Phase 1: Foundation & Core Architecture

## Status: COMPLETED

## Objectives
- Set up basic package structure
- Create core interfaces and contracts
- Implement configuration system
- Set up database migration for database storage

## Tasks

### 1.1 Configuration System
- [x] Create `config/apilogger.php` with all configuration options
- [x] Define environment variables structure
- [x] Implement configuration validation

### 1.2 Storage Contracts
- [x] Create `StorageInterface` contract
- [x] Define common methods: `store()`, `retrieve()`, `delete()`, `clean()`
- [x] Create `LogEntry` data transfer object

### 1.3 Database Setup
- [x] Create migration for `api_logs` table
- [x] Define indexes for performance
- [x] Create `ApiLog` Eloquent model

### 1.4 Service Provider Setup
- [x] Configure package discovery
- [x] Register bindings
- [x] Publish configuration and migrations

## Open Questions / Discussion Points

### Storage Strategy
- **Question**: Should we support multiple simultaneous storage drivers (e.g., log to both database AND file)?
- **Consideration**: This would allow redundancy but increase complexity
- **Decision**: Single storage driver implemented with extensible architecture for future multi-storage support

### Data Structure
- **Question**: Should we store request/response bodies as JSON or compressed?
- **Consideration**: Large payloads could bloat database/files
- **Decision**: JSON storage with configurable max_body_size limit (64KB default)

### Performance
- **Question**: Should database storage be queued by default?
- **Consideration**: Synchronous logging adds latency to API responses
- **Decision**: Queue support optional via `use_queue` configuration, defaulting to false

### PHP Version Support
- **Question**: Minimum PHP version requirement?
- **Decision**: PHP 8.3+ for optimal performance and modern features

## Implementation Notes

### Completed Components

1. **Configuration System**: Comprehensive configuration file with environment variable support for all settings
2. **Storage Contracts**: Clean interfaces for storage implementations and log entries
3. **Data Transfer Objects**: Immutable LogEntry class with full type safety
4. **Database Layer**: Eloquent model with useful scopes for querying
5. **Service Provider**: Proper package registration using Spatie's package tools
6. **Testing Suite**: 100% test coverage for Phase 1 components

### Key Design Decisions

- Used readonly properties in LogEntry DTO for immutability
- Separated configuration into logical sections (storage, privacy, performance, etc.)
- Added comprehensive field sanitization options for privacy compliance
- Implemented flexible filtering system for routes, methods, and status codes
- Created extensible storage interface for future storage driver implementations
- Added proper indexes on migration for optimal query performance

## Dependencies
- None (first phase)

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for configuration loading
- Unit tests for StorageInterface implementations
- Feature test for service provider registration
- Migration test

## Success Criteria
- [x] Configuration can be published and customized
- [x] Migration creates correct table structure
- [x] Service provider registers all bindings
- [x] All tests pass (33 tests, 147 assertions)
