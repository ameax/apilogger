- [ ] Document configuration options
- [ ] Add code examples
- [ ] Create upgrade guide
- [ ] Write contributing guidelines
- [ ] Add API documentation

### 6.4 CI/CD Setup
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions
- [ ] Set up matrix testing (PHP 8.2, 8.3, Laravel 11, 12)
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting
- [ ] Configure automatic releases
- [ ] Set up code quality checks (PHPStan, Pint)

### 6.5 Examples & Demos
- [ ] Create example Laravel app using the package
- [ ] Add common use-case examples
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

## Open Questions / Discussion Points

### Test Coverage Target
- **Question**: What's the minimum acceptable coverage?
- **Proposed**: 90% with critical paths at 100%

### Documentation Hosting
- **Question**: Where to host detailed documentation?
  - Option A: GitHub Wiki
  - Option B: Dedicated docs site (e.g., GitBook)
  - Option C: In-repo markdown files
- **Proposed**: Start with Option C, consider B for future

### Version Compatibility
- **Question**: Which Laravel versions to support?
- **Proposed**: Laravel 11.x and 12.x initially

### Example Complexity
- **Question**: How complex should examples be?
- **Proposed**: Range from simple to advanced, covering common scenarios

## Dependencies
- All other phases provide testing targets

## Testing Requirements
- PHPUnit/Pest for testing
- PHPStan level 8 for static analysis
- Laravel Pint for code style
- Test in multiple environments

## Notes
- Testing and documentation happen throughout all phases
- Each phase should include its own tests
- Documentation should be updated with each feature
- Consider documentation-driven development
