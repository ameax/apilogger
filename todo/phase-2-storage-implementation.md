# Phase 2: Storage Implementation

## Status: COMPLETED

## Objectives
- Implement DatabaseStorage driver
- Implement JsonLineStorage driver
- Create storage factory
- Implement data sanitization

## Tasks

### 2.1 DatabaseStorage Implementation
- [ ] Implement `DatabaseStorage` class
- [ ] Handle database transactions
- [ ] Implement batch inserts for performance
- [ ] Add error handling and fallback

### 2.2 JsonLineStorage Implementation
- [ ] Implement `JsonLineStorage` class
- [ ] Handle file rotation (daily, size-based)
- [ ] Implement file locking for concurrent writes
- [ ] Add compression support for archived files

### 2.3 Storage Factory
- [ ] Create `StorageManager` to resolve storage drivers
- [ ] Implement driver registration system
- [ ] Add custom driver support

### 2.4 Data Sanitization
- [ ] Create `DataSanitizer` service
- [ ] Implement field masking (passwords, tokens, etc.)
- [ ] Add configurable sensitive field detection
- [ ] Support different masking strategies (redact, hash, truncate)

## Open Questions / Discussion Points

### JsonLine File Management
- **Question**: How should we handle file rotation?
  - Option A: Daily rotation (api-2025-01-23.jsonl)
  - Option B: Size-based rotation (api-1.jsonl, api-2.jsonl when > 100MB)
  - Option C: Both with configuration
- **Proposed**: Option C - configurable rotation strategy

### Sensitive Data Detection
- **Question**: Should we auto-detect sensitive fields or only use configured list?
- **Consideration**: Auto-detection could miss custom fields or false-positive
- **Proposed**: Configured list with option to add regex patterns

### Storage Failure Handling
- **Question**: What to do if primary storage fails?
  - Option A: Throw exception (fail fast)
  - Option B: Log to Laravel's default logger as fallback
  - Option C: Queue for retry
- **Proposed**: Configurable strategy with default to Option B

### Performance Optimization
- **Question**: Should we implement write buffering for JsonLineStorage?
- **Consideration**: Buffering improves performance but risks data loss
- **Proposed**: Optional buffering with configurable flush interval

## Dependencies
- Phase 1 (Foundation) must be complete

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for each storage driver
- Integration tests with real database/filesystem
- Performance tests for bulk operations
- Tests for concurrent access handling
- Tests for data sanitization

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Both storage drivers work reliably
- [ ] Sensitive data is properly sanitized
- [ ] File rotation works as configured
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (< 10ms overhead)
- [ ] All tests pass
