# Phase 3: Middleware Implementation

## Status: PENDING

## Objectives
- Create middleware for capturing API requests/responses
- Implement request/response formatting
- Add performance measurement
- Handle different content types

## Tasks

### 3.1 Core Middleware
- [ ] Create `LogApiRequests` middleware
- [ ] Capture request data (headers, body, query params)
- [ ] Capture response data (status, body, headers)
- [ ] Measure response time accurately

### 3.2 Request/Response Processing
- [ ] Handle different content types (JSON, XML, form-data, binary)
- [ ] Implement request ID generation (UUID)
- [ ] Extract user identification (API key, user ID, etc.)
- [ ] Handle streaming responses

### 3.3 Filtering System
- [ ] Implement route filtering (include/exclude patterns)
- [ ] Add HTTP method filtering
- [ ] Support status code filtering
- [ ] Add response time threshold filtering

### 3.4 Context Enrichment
- [ ] Add client IP detection (handle proxies)
- [ ] Include application version/environment
- [ ] Add custom context providers
- [ ] Support correlation IDs for distributed tracing

## Open Questions / Discussion Points

### Middleware Placement
- **Question**: Should middleware be global or per-route?
- **Consideration**: Global is easier but less flexible
- **Proposed**: Provide both options with configuration

### Response Capture Method
- **Question**: How to capture response without affecting streaming?
  - Option A: Buffer entire response (memory intensive)
  - Option B: Tee response stream (complex)
  - Option C: Capture only for non-streaming responses
- **Proposed**: Option C with configurable size limit

### Binary Data Handling
- **Question**: How to handle binary uploads/downloads?
- **Consideration**: Binary data is not useful in logs and wastes space
- **Proposed**: Log metadata only (size, mime type) for binary content

### Error Response Handling
- **Question**: Should we capture full error responses including stack traces?
- **Consideration**: Stack traces are useful but may contain sensitive info
- **Proposed**: Configurable with default to exclude stack traces in production

### Performance Impact
- **Question**: How to minimize middleware performance impact?
- **Consideration**: Logging shouldn't significantly slow down API
- **Proposed**:
  - Use queues for heavy processing
  - Implement sampling for high-traffic endpoints
  - Add circuit breaker for storage failures

## Dependencies
- Phase 1 (Foundation) must be complete
- Phase 2 (Storage) must be complete

## Testing Requirements
- Feature tests with actual HTTP requests
- Tests for different content types
- Tests for large payloads
- Tests for streaming responses
- Performance benchmarks
- Tests for concurrent requests

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Middleware captures all configured requests
- [ ] Performance overhead < 5% for typical requests
- [ ] All content types handled correctly
- [ ] Filtering works as configured
- [ ] No memory leaks with large requests
- [ ] All tests pass
