# API Logger Package - Implementation Overview

## Package Goal
Create a flexible, performant API request/response logging package for Laravel with support for multiple storage backends (database, JSON lines files) and comprehensive configuration options. Extended to support both inbound (incoming API requests) and outbound (external API calls) logging.

## Implementation Phases

### Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Architecture
**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅
Set up basic structure, interfaces, configuration, and database schema.

### Phase 2: Storage Implementation
**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅
Implement database and JSON line storage drivers with data sanitization.

### Phase 3: Middleware Implementation
**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅
Create middleware to capture requests/responses with filtering and performance measurement.

### Phase 4: Cleanup & Maintenance
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅
Implement automatic cleanup, retention policies, and maintenance commands.

### Phase 5: Monitoring & UI Integration Points
**Priority**: LOW
**Status**: FUTURE / NOT AUTO-IMPLEMENT
Define contracts for separate UI packages (Filament, Nova, etc.).

### Phase 6: Testing & Documentation
**Priority**: ONGOING
**Status**: ONGOING
Comprehensive testing and documentation throughout all phases.

### New Phases - Outbound API Logging Feature

### Phase 7: Configuration & Feature Flags
**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅
Add feature flags for independent inbound/outbound control, update configuration structure.

### Phase 8: Outbound Logging Core
**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: PENDING
Implement Guzzle middleware for capturing external API calls, integrate with existing storage.

### Phase 9: Service Integration & Filtering
**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: PENDING
Add service/host-based filtering, correlation ID support, and service registry.

### Phase 10: Enhanced Metadata & Monitoring
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Status**: PENDING
Extend metadata structure, add model scopes, implement retry tracking and performance metrics.

### Phase 11: Documentation & Examples
**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: PENDING
Complete documentation, create integration examples, final testing.

## Development Workflow

1. **Before starting each phase**:
   - Review all previous phase implementations
   - Check for consistency with existing code
   - Review and resolve any open questions in the phase MD file
   - Update CLAUDE.md if architecture changes

2. **During implementation**:
   - Follow TDD approach
   - Update documentation as you code
   - Keep phase MD file updated with progress

3. **After completing each phase**:
   - Run full test suite
   - Update README with new features
   - Mark phase as COMPLETED
   - Review impact on next phases

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Storage**: Single storage driver at a time (initially), with option for multi-storage in future
2. **UI**: Separate packages for different admin panels (not included in core)
3. **Performance**: Queue support optional but recommended
4. **Data Safety**: Configurable sensitive data sanitization
5. **Maintenance**: Automatic cleanup with configurable retention

## Open Architecture Questions

These should be resolved before implementing Phase 1:

1. **Versioning Strategy**: Semantic versioning with which initial version?
2. **Laravel Version Support**: 11.x and 12.x confirmed, but what about future versions?
3. **PHP Version Requirements**: 8.2+ or 8.3+?
4. **Breaking Changes Policy**: How to handle future breaking changes?

## Success Metrics

- Performance overhead < 5% for typical requests
- Test coverage > 90%
- Support for high-volume APIs (>1000 req/sec)
- Zero memory leaks
- Clean, maintainable code following Laravel best practices

## Notes for Implementers

- Each phase builds on previous ones
- Don't skip phases even if they seem simple
- Testing is not optional - it's part of each phase
- Documentation should be updated continuously
- Consider backward compatibility from Phase 1
- Think about extensibility in every component
