# API Logger Package - Implementation Overview

## Package Goal
Create a flexible, performant API request/response logging package for Laravel with support for multiple storage backends (database, JSON lines files) and comprehensive configuration options.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Architecture
**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: PENDING
Set up basic structure, interfaces, configuration, and database schema.

### Phase 2: Storage Implementation
**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: PENDING
Implement database and JSON line storage drivers with data sanitization.

### Phase 3: Middleware Implementation
**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: PENDING
Create middleware to capture requests/responses with filtering and performance measurement.

### Phase 4: Cleanup & Maintenance
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Status**: PENDING
Implement automatic cleanup, retention policies, and maintenance commands.

### Phase 5: Monitoring & UI Integration Points
**Priority**: LOW
**Status**: FUTURE / NOT AUTO-IMPLEMENT
Define contracts for separate UI packages (Filament, Nova, etc.).

### Phase 6: Testing & Documentation
**Priority**: ONGOING
**Status**: ONGOING
Comprehensive testing and documentation throughout all phases.

## Development Workflow

1. **Before starting each phase**:
   - Review all previous phase implementations
   - Check for consistency with existing code
   - Review and resolve any open questions in the phase MD file
   - Update CLAUDE.md if architecture changes

2. **During implementation**:
   - Follow TDD approach
   - Update documentation as you code
   - Keep phase MD file updated with progress

3. **After completing each phase**:
   - Run full test suite
   - Update README with new features
   - Mark phase as COMPLETED
   - Review impact on next phases

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Storage**: Single storage driver at a time (initially), with option for multi-storage in future
2. **UI**: Separate packages for different admin panels (not included in core)
3. **Performance**: Queue support optional but recommended
4. **Data Safety**: Configurable sensitive data sanitization
5. **Maintenance**: Automatic cleanup with configurable retention

## Open Architecture Questions

These should be resolved before implementing Phase 1:

1. **Versioning Strategy**: Semantic versioning with which initial version?
2. **Laravel Version Support**: 11.x and 12.x confirmed, but what about future versions?
3. **PHP Version Requirements**: 8.2+ or 8.3+?
4. **Breaking Changes Policy**: How to handle future breaking changes?

## Success Metrics

- Performance overhead < 5% for typical requests
- Test coverage > 90%
- Support for high-volume APIs (>1000 req/sec)
- Zero memory leaks
- Clean, maintainable code following Laravel best practices

## Notes for Implementers

- Each phase builds on previous ones
- Don't skip phases even if they seem simple
- Testing is not optional - it's part of each phase
- Documentation should be updated continuously
- Consider backward compatibility from Phase 1
- Think about extensibility in every component
