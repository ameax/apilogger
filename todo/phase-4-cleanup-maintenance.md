# Phase 4: Cleanup & Maintenance

## Status: PENDING

## Objectives
- Implement automatic log cleanup
- Create maintenance commands
- Add log export functionality
- Implement retention policies

## Tasks

### 4.1 Cleanup Command
- [ ] Create `api-logger:clean` artisan command
- [ ] Implement age-based deletion
- [ ] Support different retention for errors vs success
- [ ] Add dry-run mode
- [ ] Implement batch deletion for performance

### 4.2 Scheduled Cleanup
- [ ] Register cleanup in scheduler
- [ ] Make schedule configurable
- [ ] Add cleanup status logging
- [ ] Implement cleanup failure alerts

### 4.3 Export Command
- [ ] Create `api-logger:export` command
- [ ] Support multiple export formats (JSON, CSV, JSONL)
- [ ] Add date range filtering
- [ ] Support streaming for large exports
- [ ] Implement compression for exports

### 4.4 Archive System
- [ ] Implement archive before delete option
- [ ] Support different archive storages (S3, local, etc.)
- [ ] Add archive compression
- [ ] Create archive restoration command

## Open Questions / Discussion Points

### Cleanup Strategy
- **Question**: Should cleanup be hard delete or soft delete?
- **Consideration**: Soft delete allows recovery but uses more space
- **Proposed**: Configurable with default to hard delete

### Archive Storage
- **Question**: Where to store archived logs?
  - Option A: Same storage as active logs
  - Option B: Separate archive storage (S3, etc.)
  - Option C: Compressed files in filesystem
- **Proposed**: Configurable archive driver system

### Retention Granularity
- **Question**: Should retention be configurable per endpoint?
- **Consideration**: Some endpoints may need longer retention for compliance
- **Proposed**: Global retention with optional per-route overrides

### Export Performance
- **Question**: How to handle large exports without memory issues?
- **Proposed**: Use Laravel's lazy collections and streaming responses

### Cleanup Performance
- **Question**: How to delete millions of old records efficiently?
- **Proposed**:
  - Chunk deletions
  - Use database partitioning if available
  - Option to run cleanup in queue

## Dependencies
- Phase 1 (Foundation) must be complete
- Phase 2 (Storage) must be complete

## Testing Requirements
- Test cleanup with various configurations
- Test export with large datasets
- Test archive and restore functionality
- Test scheduled cleanup
- Performance tests for large-scale cleanup

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Cleanup runs without blocking application
- [ ] Exports handle large datasets efficiently
- [ ] Archives are created and restorable
- [ ] Scheduled cleanup works reliably
- [ ] All tests pass
